Facebook's Ad Library is a searchable database. It includes ads related to politics or issues that have run on Facebook or Instagram. This report is a summary of the Library and includes data for ads that have been viewed by people in Ukraine for the time period selected. Making this report available to the public is part of Facebook's efforts to increase transparency in advertising.
This file contains the following fields:

Amount Spent
This metric counts the amount spent by advertisers on ads in the Library either from the ad creation date or the start of the Ad Library in March 2019 (whichever came later) until the end of the selected time period. This metric may include amounts already invoiced as well as billable amounts that haven't been invoiced yet. For ads that are currently running, these numbers may be an estimate, since it can take up to 48 hours for ad results to be processed.

The amount shown for the Ukraine report is equal to the amount spent on impressions for ads in the Library that reached people on Facebook and Instagram in Ukraine from ad accounts which had USD set as the ad account currency. For full transparency we report all relevant versions of an ad stored in Facebook's system, which means numbers in this report may differ slightly from numbers in Facebook's Ads Manager.

Number of Ads in Library
The total number of ads in the Library that were delivered on Facebook and Instagram from the start of the Ad Library in March 2019 to the end of the selected time period. For full transparency we report on all relevant versions of an ad stored in Facebook's system, which means numbers in this report may differ slightly from numbers in Facebook's Ads Manager.

Note: This report shows the number of ads related to politics or issues, and the total amount spent for those ads, reaching people in Ukraine for the selected time period. For full transparency we report on all relevant versions of an ad stored in the Facebook's systems, which means numbers in this report may differ slightly from numbers in Facebook's Ads Manager tool.
